# Rusty-Pass

A command line password manager written in Rust.

## About

This is mostly a way for me to get more comfortable in Rust.

I hope to support the following features:

- [x] Generate a random password (with minute control over the length and various character groups)
- [x] Store encrypted passwords
- [x] Search for websites using Regular Expressions
- [ ] Import/Export passwords

And that's about it.
